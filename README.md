## 🌱 Minecraft Enriched 🌱

Deeproot improves Minecraft by significantly expanding the visual aspects, biodiversity and block variety. It also restructures the game experience by improving mob behavior and reworking player progression. There is much more to explore, create and build, while being more challenging and beautiful than the vanilla experience.


## 🍀 Why should you play Deeproot? 🍀

This modpack is designed to help you explore your creativity and enjoy everything that makes the game special. There are just enough new additions and changes to keep things interesting, but not so many that it's overwhelming.
